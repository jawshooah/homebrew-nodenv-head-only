This tap provides Homebrew formulae for [plugins](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv/wiki/Plugins) extending [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv) which have no versioned releases.

## Installing Homebrew-nodenv Formulae
Just `brew tap nodenv/nodenv-head-only` and then `brew install --HEAD <formula>`. You only need to tap the repository once.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install --HEAD https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nodenv/homebrew-nodenv/master/<formula>.rb
```

## Troubleshooting
First, please run `brew update` and `brew doctor`.

Second, read the [Homebrew Troubleshooting Checklist](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Troubleshooting.md#troubleshooting).

**If you donâ€™t read these it will take us far longer to help you with your problem.**
